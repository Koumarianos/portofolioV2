# 🌟 Konstantinos Koumarianos - Portfolio V2

Hey there! This is my personal portfolio website, version 2. I've poured a lot of effort into making it look sleek and modern while keeping it super fast and easy to use. It's all about showcasing my work as a computer science student who's passionate about web development and cybersecurity.

## ✨ What Makes This Special

- **Sleek Design**: I've gone for a minimalist look with some cool glassmorphism effects and smooth gradients that just feel right.
- **Fancy Cursor**: There's a custom cursor that follows your mouse with a nice trail effect – it's interactive and fun.
- **Smooth Animations**: Everything scrolls into view with these nice animations, and there are magnetic buttons that react to your cursor.
- **Typewriter Effect**: The hero section has this cool typewriter animation that cycles through my different roles.
- **Project Cards**: I've got my featured projects laid out in cards with hover effects that make them pop.
- **Skill Bars**: Animated progress bars show my proficiency in different technologies.
- **Contact Form**: There's a simple form that sends messages straight to my Discord via a webhook.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML5**: Clean, semantic markup.
- **CSS3**: Custom properties for theming, flexbox and grid for layouts, plus some fun animations.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks here – just pure JS for all the interactivity. I used things like Intersection Observer for scroll animations and smooth scrolling.
- **Fonts**: Inter for the main text and JetBrains Mono for code-like stuff, plus Font Awesome icons.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Want to check it out locally? Here's how:

1. Grab the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Koumarianos/portfolio-v2.git
   cd portfolio-v2
   ```

2. Fire it up in your browser. You can use a local server or just open index.html directly. For the best experience, try something like:
   ```bash
   # With Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Or with Node.js
   npx http-server
   ```

3. Head to http://localhost:8000 and enjoy!

## 🎨 Tweaking It

Feel free to use this as a base for your own portfolio! Here's a quick guide to customizing:

- **Colors**: Tweak the CSS variables at the top of style.css to change the whole color scheme.

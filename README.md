# 🌟 Konstantinos Koumarianos - Portfolio V2

Welcome to my personal portfolio website (Version 2) — built to look sleek and modern while staying fast, lightweight, and easy to use. It showcases my work as a computer science student with a strong interest in web development and cybersecurity.

🌍 **Live Website:** **koumarianos24.gr**

## ✨ What Makes This Special

- **Sleek Design**: Minimalist UI with glassmorphism effects and smooth gradients.
- **Fancy Cursor**: Custom cursor with a subtle trailing effect for a more interactive feel.
- **Smooth Animations**: Scroll-reveal animations + magnetic buttons that react to cursor movement.
- **Typewriter Effect**: Hero section cycles through different roles with a typewriter animation.
- **Project Cards**: Featured projects in interactive cards with clean hover effects.
- **Skill Bars**: Animated progress bars to visualize tech proficiency.
- **Contact Form**: Sends messages directly to my Discord via webhook.

- **CSS3**: Custom properties, flexbox/grid layouts, animations, responsive design.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Pure JS (Intersection Observer, smooth scrolling, interactivity).
